> [!NOTE]
> **🎉 Thank you for 5,000+ downloads.** From a frameless Electron wrapper in February to a cross-platform research studio in May — every bug report, feature request, and 20-rupee [Buy Me A Chai](https://buymeachai.ezee.li/GyaneshOnProduct) (UPI supported) shaped what landed in v3.0. The project is now openly accepting contributions — see the [**Roadmap**](#-roadmap--v3-and-beyond) below for `good first issue` work that could ship in the next release.

---

## About — the 5 Ws

**What.** A native cross-platform desktop wrapper for Google NotebookLM, built on Electron, that turns the web app into a deeply integrated research utility — with transparency, customizable global hotkeys, multi-pane research (up to 3), dark mode, Markdown export, URL drop capture, and a mini Quick-Clip overlay.

**Who.** Built solo by **Gyanesh Samanta** ([@GyaneshSamanta](https://github.com/GyaneshSamanta)) — now openly accepting community contributions.

**When.** Active from **February 8, 2026 onwards** — v1.0 (wrapper), v2.0 (Ghost Mode + Quick-Clip + Split View), v2.1 (installer + auto-update), v3.0 (cross-platform + power-user features + open-source foundation).

**Where.** A nights-and-weekends project now in the hands of **5,000+** researchers, students, and analysts on Windows, macOS, and Linux who wanted NotebookLM to behave like a first-class desktop app.

**Why.** NotebookLM is a phenomenal research tool — but living in a browser tab means you lose half its leverage. No global hotkey to capture a clipping. No transparency to reference a PDF underneath. No way to compare two notebooks side-by-side without two browser windows. This app fixes all of that.

---

## The Story

It started as a simple Electron wrapper around `notebooklm.google.com` — a frameless window with a custom title bar, persistent login, and Windows toast notifications when an Audio Overview finished generating. Useful, but still mostly a tab-with-extra-steps. The first download numbers (a few hundred) suggested people wanted *more* than a wrapper.

Version 2.0 was the leap. **Ghost Mode** added an opacity slider to the title bar, so the entire window can fade to translucent — perfect for transcribing from a video underneath or copying from a PDF without the constant Alt-Tab dance. **Quick-Clip** registered a global `Ctrl+Alt+N` hotkey: copy text from anywhere, hit the chord, and NotebookLM jumps to the foreground and pastes the clipping into the active note instantly. **Split View** turned the single window into a two-pane research studio sharing the same login session — one notebook on brain-activity research, another on the Q3 earnings call, side-by-side without juggling tabs. **Native drag-and-drop** lets you fling PDFs, TXT, and Markdown straight onto the window to trigger NotebookLM's upload pipeline. Every one of these features answers a complaint I had personally — and apparently most of the **2,000+ downloads** so far had it too.

Version 2.1 was the boring-but-important release: a real NSIS installer, an electron-updater pipeline that ships updates in the background, and a portable `.exe` for users who don't want anything touching their registry. The whole stack stays delightfully thin — Electron 34, vanilla JS/HTML/CSS, two runtime deps (`auto-launch`, `electron-updater`).

**Version 3.0 is the 5,000-download milestone release.** It's the leap from "a Windows app for me" to "a research tool worth contributing to." A unified **settings system** with a real preferences panel. **Dark mode** with a proper CSS-variable palette. **Customizable global hotkeys** so power users can rebind Quick-Clip to whatever fits their muscle memory. **Always-on-top** for reference workflows. **Three-pane multi-view** for the research geeks. A **mini Quick-Clip overlay** that pops up at the cursor when the main window is hidden — no more forced foregrounding. **Markdown export** of your notes. **URL drop capture** so dragging a link from the browser pushes it as a source. And — finally — **macOS and Linux** builds via a cross-platform CI pipeline, with issue templates and a curated `good first issue` backlog so anyone reading this can ship the next feature.

## What's New in v3.0

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🌐 **macOS + Linux** | First-class builds for Mac (`.dmg` / `.zip`) and Linux (`AppImage` / `.deb`) via cross-platform CI. |
| 🌙 **Dark Mode** | Full dark theme with CSS variables. Follows system or pick light / dark manually. |
| ⚙ **Settings Panel** | Unified preferences modal — theme, hotkey, always-on-top, default pane count, all in one place. |
| ⌨ **Customizable Hotkey** | Rebind Quick-Clip to any combo. Conflict-detected; reverts gracefully. |
| 📌 **Always-on-Top** | Pin the window above everything else — perfect for reference workflows. |
| 🪟 **3-Pane View** | Cycle 1 / 2 / 3 panes. Active-pane tracking routes Quick-Clip to where you're looking. |
| ✨ **Mini Quick-Clip Overlay** | When the main window is hidden, the hotkey shows a small overlay at the cursor — Enter to clip, Esc to cancel. |
| ⬇ **Markdown Export** | One click to export the current notebook's notes as a clean `.md` file. |
| 🔗 **URL Drop Capture** | Drag a link from your browser onto the window — it auto-fills NotebookLM's Add URL field. |
| 🩹 **Error / Retry UI** | When NotebookLM fails to load, you get a Retry button — not a blank pane. |
| 🤝 **Open to Contributors** | Issue templates, labels, CI, smoke tests, and a [Roadmap](#-roadmap--v3-and-beyond) of `good first issue` work. |

## Quick Start

### Download & Run

1. Grab the latest release from the [**Releases page**](../../releases).
2. Pick your flavour:
   - **Installer** (`-Setup.exe`) — recommended. Adds shortcuts and enables background auto-update.
   - **Portable** (`.exe`) — just download and run, nothing touches your system.
   - **Linux** (`.AppImage` / `.deb`) — see [Ubuntu & Linux](#ubuntu--linux) below.
3. Run it. That's the whole setup.

> **Tip:** Pin `NotebookLM-for-Windows.exe` to your taskbar for one-click access.

> [!WARNING]
> **Upgrading from < v2.1?** Switch to the **Installer** build — that's where automatic background updates kick in.

---

## Ubuntu & Linux

The Electron app itself is cross-platform, and this fork ships first-class Linux support:

- **Packaging**: `npm run dist:linux` produces `.AppImage` and `.deb` (electron-builder `linux` target).
- **Auto-update** is disabled on Linux (no feed configured) instead of throwing on startup.
- **Wayland/X11 safe** opacity handling (Ghost Mode degrades gracefully on Wayland where compositors reject per-window opacity).
- **Tray, Quick-Clip global hotkey, split panes, auto-launch** (via `~/.config/autostart`) all work as on Windows.

Run from source on Ubuntu 22.04+:

```bash
sudo apt install -y libnss3 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm1 libasound2   # electron deps
npm install
npm start          # or: npx electron .
npm run dist:linux # AppImage + deb
```

## Agent CLI (`nbd`) — drive the app from Codex / Claude Code

The app hosts a **loopback-only, bearer-token-authenticated control server**, and ships a CLI (`nbd` / `notebooklm-desktop`) that exposes every feature as JSON commands — designed for AI agents and scripts:

```bash
npx . cli.js status              # app/window/panes/proxy/tunnel snapshot (JSON)
nbd tunnel import "vless://…"    # configure the embedded tunnel to your VPS
nbd proxy check                  # connectivity check through the app session
nbd open <notebook-id>           # navigate the active pane
nbd panes 2 && nbd ghost on
nbd notes-export ~/notes.md
```

Full command reference: [docs/agent-cli.md](docs/agent-cli.md).

## Independent proxy & mainland-optimized routing

The app never touches your system proxy. Its `persist:notebooklm` session gets its own rules, with several modes ([docs/proxy.md](docs/proxy.md)):

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| `off` / `system` | direct / follow OS |
| `tunnel` | **embedded sing-box client** (auto-managed child process) speaking `vless+reality` / `hysteria2` straight to your VPS over IPv4/IPv6 — no Mihomo/TUN, no admin rights, works on any machine after importing one URI |
| `vps` | all traffic through a plain `http://`/`socks5://` proxy URL |
| `mainland` | split routing: only Google/NotebookLM domains via the proxy, everything else direct |
| `manual` | raw Chromium proxy rules |

Mainland-network reality check: a plaintext HTTP CONNECT proxy carrying `CONNECT notebooklm.google.com:443` gets keyword-reset by the GFW, so the `tunnel` mode (Reality over TCP 443) is the reliable path there.

## This fork's other changes

- Agent control server + CLI ([docs/agent-cli.md](docs/agent-cli.md))
- Embedded VPS tunnel + proxy modes ([docs/proxy.md](docs/proxy.md))
- Linux/Ubuntu support & packaging
- 22 smoke tests (original 6 + proxy/tunnel/control-server suites)
